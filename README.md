GitHub GeoJSON Virtual Layers
=============================

Exploring the concept of storing GeoJSON features in individual files in a single repository and using virtual layers to visualize them.

This concept should enable
- Applications to better circumvent GitHub file size limitations
- The ability to fetch only those features required byt the application
- The ability to track edits/metadata for individual features

This approach is based upon a concept put forth by Mike Byrne.
